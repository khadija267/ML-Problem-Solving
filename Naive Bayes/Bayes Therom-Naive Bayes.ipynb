    "\n",
    "Bayes Theorem is one of the earliest probabilistic inference algorithms. It was developed by Reverend Bayes (which he used to try and infer the existence of God no less), and still performs extremely well for certain use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's best to understand this theorem using an example. Let's say you are a member of the Secret Service and you have been deployed to protect the Democratic presidential nominee during one of his/her campaign speeches. Being a public event that is open to all, your job is not easy and you have to be on the constant lookout for threats. So one place to start is to put a certain threat-factor for each person. So based on the features of an individual, like age, whether the person is carrying a bag, looks nervous, etc., you can make a judgment call as to whether that person is a viable threat. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an individual ticks all the boxes up to a level where it crosses a threshold of doubt in your mind, you can take action and remove that person from the vicinity. Bayes Theorem works in the same way, as we are computing the probability of an event (a person being a threat) based on the probabilities of certain related events (age, presence of bag or not, nervousness of the person, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider is the independence of these features amongst each other. For example if a child looks nervous at the event then the likelihood of that person being a threat is not as much as say if it was a grown man who was nervous. To break this down a bit further, here there are two features we are considering, age AND nervousness. Say we look at these features individually, we could design a model that flags ALL persons that are nervous as potential threats. However, it is likely that we will have a lot of false positives as there is a strong chance that minors present at the event will be nervous. Hence by considering the age of a person along with the 'nervousness' feature we would definitely get a more accurate result as to who are potential threats and who aren't. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the 'Naive' bit of the theorem where it considers each feature to be independent of each other which may not always be the case and hence that can affect the final judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, Bayes Theorem calculates the probability of a certain event happening (in our case, a message being spam) based on the joint probabilistic distributions of certain other events (in our case, the appearance of certain words in a message). We will dive into the workings of Bayes Theorem later in the mission, but first, let us understand the data we are going to work with."

    "Now that we have our dataset in the format that we need, we can move onto the next portion of our mission which is the  algorithm we will use to make our predictions to classify a message as spam or not spam. Remember that at the start of the mission we briefly discussed the Bayes theorem but now we shall go into a little more detail. In layman's terms, the Bayes theorem calculates the probability of an event occurring, based on certain other probabilities that are related to the event in question. It is composed of \"prior probabilities\" - or just \"priors.\" These \"priors\" are the probabilities that we are aware of, or that are given to us. And Bayes theorem is also composed of the \"posterior probabilities,\" or just \"posteriors,\" which are the probabilities we are looking to compute using the \"priors\". \n",

    "`P(Pos|D)` is the probability of getting a positive result on a test done for detecting diabetes, given that you have diabetes. This has a value `0.9`. In other words the test is correct 90% of the time. This is also called the Sensitivity or True Positive Rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "`P(Neg|~D)` is the probability of getting a negative result on a test done for detecting diabetes, given that you do not have diabetes. This also has a value of `0.9` and is therefore correct, 90% of the time. This is also called the Specificity or True Negative Rate.\n",

    "The term 'Naive' in Naive Bayes comes from the fact that the algorithm considers the features that it is using to make the predictions to be independent of each other, which may not always be the case. So in our Diabetes example, we are considering only one feature, that is the test result. Say we added another feature, 'exercise'. Let's say this feature has a binary value of `0` and `1`, where the former signifies that the individual exercises less than or equal to 2 days a week and the latter signifies that the individual exercises greater than or equal to 3 days a week. If we had to use both of these features, namely the test result and the value of the 'exercise' feature, to compute our final probabilities, Bayes' theorem would fail. Naive Bayes' is an extension of Bayes' theorem that assumes that all the features are independent of each other. "

    "Congratulations! You have implemented the Naive Bayes' theorem from scratch. Our analysis shows that there is only a 6.6% chance that Jill Stein of the Green Party uses the words 'freedom' and 'immigration' in her speech as compared with the 93.3% chance for Gary Johnson of the Libertarian party."

    "For another example of Naive Bayes, let's consider searching for images using the term 'Sacramento Kings' in a search engine. In order for us to get the results pertaining to the Scramento Kings NBA basketball team, the search engine needs to be able to associate the two words together and not treat them individually. If the search engine only searched for the words individually, we would get results of images tagged with 'Sacramento,' like pictures of city landscapes, and images of 'Kings,' which might be pictures of crowns or kings from history. But associating the two terms together would produce images of the basketball team. In the first approach we would treat the words as independent entities, so it would be considered 'naive.' We don't usually want this approach from a search engine, but it can be extremely useful in other cases. \n",

    "Applying this to our problem of classifying messages as spam, the Naive Bayes algorithm *looks at each word individually and not as associated entities* with any kind of link between them. In the case of spam detectors, this usually works, as there are certain red flag words in an email which are highly reliable in classifying it as spam. For example, emails with words like 'viagra' are usually classified as spam."
